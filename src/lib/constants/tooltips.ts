export const DELINQUENCY_IMPACT_TOOLTIP =
  "Delinquency rate tracks the share of occupied units that are behind on rent. A higher rate drags the target occupancy, triggers more evictions once grace periods expire, slows cash collection, and chips away at reputation-driven demand. Softer plans cushion evictions but keep more revenue tied up until tenants catch up.";
